      "question": "Adsorption is accompanied by .....",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decrease in temperature",
        "b": "Decrease in enthalpy of the system",
        "c": "Increase in enthalpy of the system",
        "d": "All is correct"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cooling may be observed externally but not always a defining feature.",
        "b": "Correct. Adsorption is exothermic, so enthalpy decreases.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Enthalpy decreases, not increases.",
        "d": "Not all options are correct."

      "question": "The colouring matter which gets adsorbed on activated charcoal is called...",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Adsorbate",
        "b": "Adsorber",
        "c": "None of the above",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Adsorbate is the substance being adsorbed.",
        "b": "Adsorber is not a standard term in this context.",
        "c": "Incorrect, 'adsorbate' is the correct term.",
        "d": "Adsorbent is the surface on which adsorption happens."

        "a": "10-100KJ",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Too broad and not representative of chemisorption specifically.",
        "b": "This range is too low for chemisorption; more typical of physisorption.",
        "c": "Correct. Chemisorption has high heat of adsorption.",
        "d": "Still within physisorption range."
