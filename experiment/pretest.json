      "answers": {
        "a": "Absorption",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Absorption is the bulk phenomenon, not surface-based.",
        "b": "Sorption is a general term covering both absorption and adsorption.",
        "c": "Correct. Adsorption is a surface phenomenon involving accumulation at interfaces.",
        "d": "Occlusion refers to trapping, not surface accumulation."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Ammonia can be adsorbed, but not as efficiently as COâ‚‚.",
        "b": "Nitrogen is adsorbed weakly.",
        "c": "Hydrogen has low adsorption.",
