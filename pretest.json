      "question": "The change in concentration in the interfacial layers between two phases of a system by surface forces is called...",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Absorption",
        "b": "Sorption",
        "c": "Adsorption",
        "d": "Occlusion"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Absorption is the bulk phenomenon, not surface-based.",
        "b": "Sorption is a general term covering both absorption and adsorption.",
        "c": "Correct. Adsorption is a surface phenomenon involving accumulation at interfaces.",
        "d": "Occlusion refers to trapping, not surface accumulation."

      "question": "Which of the following gases is adsorbed by charcoal?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Ammonia",
        "b": "Nitrogen",
        "c": "Hydrogen",
        "d": "Carbon dioxide"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Ammonia can be adsorbed, but not as efficiently as COâ‚‚.",
        "b": "Nitrogen is adsorbed weakly.",
        "c": "Hydrogen has low adsorption.",
        "d": "Correct. Carbon dioxide is readily adsorbed by charcoal."

      "question": "Adsorption is accompanied by .....",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decrease in temperature",
        "b": "Decrease in enthalpy of the system",
        "c": "Increase in enthalpy of the system",
        "d": "All is correct"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cooling may be observed externally but not always a defining feature.",
        "b": "Correct. Adsorption is exothermic, so enthalpy decreases.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Enthalpy decreases, not increases.",
        "d": "Not all options are correct."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Adsorbate is the substance being adsorbed.",
        "b": "Adsorber is not a standard term in this context.",
        "c": "Incorrect, 'adsorbate' is the correct term.",
        "d": "Adsorbent is the surface on which adsorption happens."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Too broad and not representative of chemisorption specifically.",
        "b": "This range is too low for chemisorption; more typical of physisorption.",
        "c": "Correct. Chemisorption has high heat of adsorption.",
        "d": "Still within physisorption range."
